 * Figure 6.5 A simple backtracking algorithm for constraint satisfaction
 * problems. The algorithm is modeled on the recursive depth-first search of
 * Chapter 3. By varying the functions SELECT-UNASSIGNED-VARIABLE and
 * ORDER-DOMAIN-VALUES, we can implement the general-purpose heuristic discussed
 * in the text. The function INFERENCE can optionally be used to impose arc-,
 * path-, or k-consistency, as desired. If a value choice leads to failure
 * (noticed wither by INFERENCE or by BACKTRACK), then value assignments
 * (including those made by INFERENCE) are removed from the current assignment
 * and a new value is tried.

 * The most widely known form of best-first search is called A* Search
 * (pronounced "A-star search"). It evaluates nodes by combining g(n), the cost
 * to reach the node, and h(n), the cost to get from the node to the goal:<br>
 * f(n) = g(n) + h(n).<br>
 * <br>
 * Since g(n) gives the path cost from the start node to node n, and h(n) is the
 * estimated cost of the cheapest path from n to the goal, we have<br>
 * f(n) = estimated cost of the cheapest solution through n.

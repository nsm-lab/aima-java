= AIMA-GUI =

by Ruediger Lunde (Ruediger.Lunde@gmail.com)

This project contains graphical applications and command line demos, which
demonstrate the use of some of the aima-core project features. Currently, it
focuses on search algorithms and agent concepts. Application class names end
with "App" and command line demo class names with "Demo". An all-in-one
application called aima.gui.applications.AimaDemoApp is provided which is
a starter for all the other applications and demos.

== Requirements ==
# Depends on the aima-core project. 

== Current Release: 1.0.9-AIMA-GUI Chp 7 Rewrite Support ==
1.0.9-Chp 7 Rewrite Support : 10 Aug 2014 :<br>
  * Updated to work with the latest version of aima-core (0.11.0).
  
== Running the GUIs and Command Line Demos ==
Under the release/ directory you should find two jar files, aima-core.jar and aima-gui.jar, ensure these are on your CLASSPATH, the different GUI programs that can be run using these are:
 * java -jar aima-gui.jar
   + this will run the default AimaDemoApp, this allows you to run all other applications from a central location as well as all of the current command line demos.
 
 * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.applications.vacuum.VacuumApp
   + provides a demo of the different agents described in Chapter 2 for tackling the Vacuum World.
  * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.applications.search.games.EightPuzzleApp
   + provides a demo of the different search algorithms described in Chapter 3 and 4.
 * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.applications.search.games.NQueensApp
   + provides a demo of the different search algorithms described in Chapter 3 and 4.
 * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.applications.search.games.TicTacToeApp
   + provides a demo of the different search algorithms described in Chapter 5.
 * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.applications.search.map.RouteFindingAgentApp
   + provides a demo of the different agents/search algorithms described in Chapters 3 and 4, for tackling route planning tasks within simplified Map environments.
 * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.applications.search.csp.MapColoringApp
   + provides a demo of the different csp algorithms described in Chapters 6.
 
The following command line demos can be run as well:
 * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.agent.TrivialVacuumDemo
 * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.learning.LearningDemo
 * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.logic.DPLLDemo
 * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.logic.FolDemo
 * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.logic.PLFCEntailsDemo
 * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.logic.PLResolutionDemo
 * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.logic.TTEntailsDemo
 * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.logic.WalkSatDemo
 * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.probability.ProbabilityDemo
 * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.search.CSPDemo
 * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.search.EightPuzzleDemo
 * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.search.NQueensDemo
 * java -classpath aima-gui.jar aima.gui.demo.search.TicTacToeDemo
